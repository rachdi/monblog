It is also, by far, my ugliest piece of code. You've been warned.\n\n### Install and Usage\nUnleash your inner masochist and enjoy `uncaughtException` and stack-traces, just by installing with:\n\n  `npm install coffee-trace`\n\nand then\n\n```coffeescript\n# Require it at the very beginning of your code\nrequire('coffee-trace')\n```\n\n### Example\nRunning this..\n\n```coffeescript\nrequire('coffee-trace')\n\ntest = ->\n  people =\n    john:\n      first_name: 'john'\n      last_name: 'doe'\n    mary:\n      first_name: 'mary'\n      last_name: 'jane'\n\n  console.log(\"Welcome\", people[p].first_name, people[p].last_name, \"!!!\") for p in ['john', 'mary', 'josh']\n\nprocess.nextTick test\n```\n\nwill result in this:\n![Coffee-Trace](https://github.com/xenomuta/coffee-trace/raw/master/img/example.png \"Coffee-Trace example\")\n\n### Why?\nIf you love Coffee-Script and Node.js, you will provably also be frustrated by the challenges of quickly finding and debugging the coffee-script line corresponding to the one pointed out by the stack-trace.\n\nI've been searching a cleaner solution myself, and have found some very useful [links](http://www.adaltas.com/blog/2012/02/15/coffeescript-print-debug-line/ \"Coffee script, how do I debug that damn js line?\") and [discussions](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/558 \"links and discussions\"), but am yet unsatisfied. So, while [SourceMaps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/ \"SourceMaps\") implementation in Coffee-Script is a reality, this is the least I can do.\n\n### ToDo ( Utopic Future High Hopes)\n* Beautify and comment code\n* Async API for code sandboxing\n* Returning a decent stack trace object (with coffee file, line and all).\n* A more complete testing\n",
